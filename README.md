# Video Processing
Eventually this project will involve some form of video processing using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). For now I have got OpenCV working with C++, exemplified by the current version of main.cpp, which is taken (with slight modification) from [here](https://github.com/divy-works/opencv_cpp_windows_setup).

For reference, I have installed OpenCV as a *dynamic library* by following [these instructions](https://medium.com/@divyendu.narayan/opencv-c-setup-for-microsoft-visual-studio-2019-and-visual-studio-code-in-windows-64-bit-911b1c733b3e) (using version 4.5 rather than 4.1.2). Built with [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) version 4.3.1 installed.
